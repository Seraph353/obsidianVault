Every device on a network has an [[IP Addresses |IP Address]], an individually assigned address that is used to identify the device. The IP is normally assigned by the router using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).

The IP address used on the local network is separate to the one used for public communication (Most consumer routers use 192.168.x.x for their network addresses, but external addresses could be different and changeable.)
