Hosts use IP addresses to send and receive network packets from other hosts.

There are two types of IP address:
- IPv4: Four 8-bit numbers, eg. 192.168.10.120
	- Small size limits possible number of available addresses
- IPv6: 128-bit address, eg. 2345:0425:2CA1:0000:0000:0567:5673:23b5
	- Large size allows for many possible addresses (over 320 trillion)
